    "## INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the shift in terms of how the average human consumes content in today’s creator-driven economy, data driven insights are at the heart of identifying what drives success for these hedonic experiences. Collaboration has become more important than ever as it is quite common to see multiple artists collaborating on their tracks. Music and Short form videos are a natural synergy now as they mesh well together and create greater value through that association. Musicians these days are also focused on trying to create tracks that can go viral on social media as that virality further fuels their success in terms of views, repeats and reshares.\n",
    "\n",
    "We at ABOT Wall Consultants are a Music Industry market research firm where clients come to us for insights so that they can leverage the market research studies and incorporate those in their decision making process to create successfull and viral music content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have a new client who is an upcoming artist in the industry by the name of \"Lil Py\" and requires our insights and help to aid his creative music decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our project is to investigate and map the factors that make a song successful beyond the traditional metrics in music. Through our analysis, we aim to visualize the effect of these factors to potentially aid creative music decisions through the power of data driven decision making."

    "### DATA COLLECTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first source of data collected for the project and analysis is from Kaggle. The Kaggle dataset describes songs from the period 1942 to 2021. Songs from various genres like pop, EDM, hip-hop, rap, latin, rock etc are included along with the artist's information, release dates, number of streams for each song and the number of followers the artist has along with some additional data. Some other insightful data columns in the data set contain song features such as its popularity relative to  other songs, the energy, valence, acousticness, dancability which will be used to analyse the how these factors influence the song's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Getting real-time data from Spotify API or Spotipy library: Along with the aforementioned Kaggle dataset, we will analyse the songs released in 2022 to compare how the music preferences have changed throughout the years. In order to do so, the same song features mentioned above are required. These can be obtained by using Spotipy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Song Features and what they mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acousticness: \n",
    "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Danceability: \n",
    "Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Liveness:\n",
    "Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loudness: \n",
    "The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Speechiness: \n",
    "Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Valence: \n",
    "A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Duration (ms):\n",
    "The track length in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chord/Key:\n",
    "The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation which is mentioned below <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Notation | Chord |\n",
    "|----------|-------|\n",

    "## RATIONALE FOR HIGHER WEIGHTAGE:\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe, in our humble opinion, that our project should be graded more heavily on the data processing side as we performed multiple operations that went above and beyond the requirements of traditional databases. In addition to just collecting and cleaning our databse, we collected real time data from the Spotipy API which had a lot of standardization and formatting issues. In addition to these, we also had to separately query the song ids for each song in the real time data to collect further information that was consistent with the columns of our master db. We also noticed several instances (~238) of songs where the data was corrupted or wrong. Such inconsistencies were tackled by using multiple queries that matched for ids and updated each column to remain consistent with the overall parent database."

The song with the highest popularity score, \"Unholy,\" is a collaboration, although the number of fans who follow the artist isn't that high. This reveals the fact that musicians with less followers can collaborate to create music, which raises their success measure. We can see that collaborations range in popularity from 41 to 100. The graph's X axis is designated as Song Name to provide readers a general notion of the song's title and featured performer. Let's examine the graph using only the singles that artists have generated."

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize our results, we can infer some intriguing patterns and relationships that can influence the decision making of our client who is a an upcoming artist:\n",
    "1) Artist followers and popularity clearly are not strong indicators of success or high stream count. Our client can safely assume that his low follower count, as a result of his early stage music career, will not have a significant impact on his stream count and success.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) From the lense of genres, we can infer that no individual genre has a huge impact on the success of a song. The overall muscial attributes of a track such as acousticness, danceability etc. also do not showcase any significant impact for the popularity or virality of a track. This is a great insight as it allows our client to explore their creative side and produce music that is true to their experiences and music vibe.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) When exploring the relationship between duration and the success, we could observe that the market demand for shorter duration of tracks has been on an uptrend and that the most streamed songs are typically between 140-210 seconds. Thus, our recommendation would be to produce tracks that are aligned with that range of duration to drive maximum success and streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Finally, while exploring the effect of collaboration with other artists, we observed that when artists collaborate, their default threshold for popularity is 40 base points. This is strikingly different for the case when artists do not collaborate as the base threshold is 1 basis point. When thinking about this intuitively, it adds up as the more the artists collaborate, the more searched and viral the track will be due to the interaction of their different listening audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results are extremely meaningful as we believe that if our client focusses on collaboration with new artists while creating shorter duration tracks and exploring their musical creativity, they should be able to churn out bangers month after month!"
